The New Economics of Liquidity and Financial Frictionsis a book
                    about a new branch of economics that is largely a synthesis of macro and
                    finance. In many ways, it is a radical departure from the older, frictionless
                    approach still prevalent in economic textbooks and most of academia. This book
                    provides a new understanding and approach to asset pricing, risk measurement and
                    management, central banking policy, and the overall working of todayâ€™s
                    economy, including questions of financial stability.
