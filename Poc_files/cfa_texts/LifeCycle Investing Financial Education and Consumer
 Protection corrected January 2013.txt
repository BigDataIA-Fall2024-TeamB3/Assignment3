Third in the series of Boston University–sponsored conferences titled
                    “The Future of Life-Cycle Saving and Investing,” the May 2011
                    conference again brought together academic researchers, educators, advisers, and
                    regulators. This time, we analyzed the gaps in consumers’ current
                    financial knowledge, how those gaps might be narrowed through financial
                    education programs, and how consumer protection regarding financial products
                    might be strengthened—with a focus on low- and middle-income households.
                    Although there was general agreement that consumers of financial products and
                    services make many costly mistakes, there was also considerable disagreement
                    about relying primarily on consumer financial education programs to correct
                    those mistakes.
